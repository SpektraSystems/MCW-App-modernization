## Exercise 10: Create an app in PowerApps

Duration: 15 minutes

Since creating mobile apps is a long development cycle, Contoso is interested in using PowerApps to create mobile applications to add functionality not currently offered by their app rapidly. In this scenario, they want to be able to edit the Policy lookup values (Silver, Gold, Platinum, etc.), which they are unable to do in the current app. In this task, you get them up and running with a new app created in PowerApps, which connects to the `ContosoInsurance` database and performs basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations against the Policies table.

### Task 1: Sign up for a PowerApps account

1. Go to PowerApp web portal and sign up for a new account, using the same account you have been using in Azure. You can copy paste the below url in your VM and signup.
   ```
     https://web.powerapps.com
   ```

2. You may receive an email asking you to verify your account request, with a link to continue the process.

3. Download and install **PowerApps Studio** from the Microsoft store: <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/powerapps/9nblggh5z8f3>.

> **Note**: If you are unable to install PowerApps on the LabVM, you can run install it on your local machine and run the steps for this exercise there.

### Task 2: Create new SQL connection

1. From the PowerApps website, expand the **Data** option from the left-hand navigation menu, then select **Connections**.

2. Select the **+ New connection** button.
