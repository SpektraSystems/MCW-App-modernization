## Exercise 8: Add Cognitive Search for policy documents

Duration: 15 minutes

Contoso has requested the ability to perform full-text searching on policy documents. Previously, they have not been able to extract information from the documents in a usable way, but they have read about cognitive search with the Azure Cognitive Search Service ```(https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/cognitive-search-concept-intro)```, and are interested to learn if it could be used to make the data in their search index more useful. In this exercise, you configure cognitive search for the policies blob storage container.

### Task 1: Add Azure Cognitive Search to Storage account

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your **Storage account** resource by selecting **Resource groups** from Azure services list, selecting the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group, and then selecting the **contoso{UniqueId}** Storage account resource from the list of resources.

2. On the Storage account blade, select **Add Azure Search** from the left-hand menu, and then on the **Select a search service** tab, select your search service.

3. Select **Next: Connect to your data**.

4. On the **Connect to your data** tab, enter the following:

   - **Data Source**: Leave the value of **Azure Blob Storage** selected.
   - **Name**: Enter **policy-docs**.
   - **Data to extract**: Select **Content and metadata**.
   - **Parsing mode**: Leave set to **Default**.
   - **Connection string**: Leave this set to the pre-populated connection string for your Storage account.
   - **Container name**: Enter **policies**.

5. Select **Next: Add cognitive search (Optional)**.

6. On the **Add cognitive search** tab, set the following configuration:

   - Expand Attach Cognitive Services, and select your Cognitive Services account.
   - Expand Add enrichments:
     - **Skillset name**: Enter **policy-docs-skillset**.
     - **Text cognitive skills**: Check this box to select all the skills.

7. Select **Next: Customize target index**.

8. On the **Customize target index tab**, do the following:

   - **Index name**: Enter **policy-docs-index**.
   - Check the top Retrievable box, to check all items underneath it.
   - Check the top Searchable box, to check all items underneath it.

   ![The Customize target index tab is displayed with the Index name, Retrievable checkbox and Searchable checkbox highlighted.](media/add-azure-search-customize-target-index.png "Add Azure Search")

9. Select **Next: Create an indexer**.

10. On the **Create an indexer** tab, enter **policy-docs-indexer** as the name, select **Once** for the schedule, and then select **Submit**.

    ![The name field and submit button are highlighted on the Create an indexer tab.](media/add-azure-search-create-an-indexer.png "Add Azure Search")

    > **Note**: For this hands-on lab, we are only running the indexer once, at the time of creation. In a production application, you would probably choose a schedule such as hourly or daily to run the indexer. This would allow you to bring in any new data that arrives in the target blob storage account.

11. Within a few seconds, you receive a notification in the Azure portal that the import was successfully configured.

### Task 2: Review search results

In this task, you run a query against your search index to review the enrichments added by cognitive search to policy documents.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your **Search service** resource by selecting **Resource groups** from Azure services list, selecting the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group, and then selecting the **contoso-search-UniqueId** Search service resource from the list of resources.

   ![](media/app16.png)

2. On the Search service blade, select **Indexers**.

    ![In Contoso Insurance search service, Indexers is highlighted and selected.](media/azure-search-indexers.png "Search Service")

3. Note the status of the policy-docs-indexer. Once the indexer has run, it should display a status of **Success**. If the status is **In progress**, select **Refresh** every 20-30 seconds until it changes to **Success**.

   > If you see a status of **No history**, select the policy-docs-indexer, and select **Run** on the Indexer blade.

4. Now select **Search explorer** in the Search service blade toolbar.

   ![Search explorer is highlighted on the Search service toolbar.](media/search-service-explorer.png "Search service")

5. On the **Search explorer** blade, select **Search**.

6. In the search results, inspect the returned documents, paying special attention to the fields added by the cognitive skills you added when creating the search index. These fields are `People`, `Organizations`, `Locations`, `Keyphrases`, `Language`, and `Translated_Text`.

7. For comparison, the same document without cognitive search skills enabled would look similar to the following:

   ```json
   {
        "@search.score": 1,
        "content": "\nContoso Insurance - Your Platinum Policy\n\nPolicy Holder: Igor Cooke\nPolicy #: COO13CE2ZLOKD\nEffective Coverage Dates: 22 July 2008 - 13 August 2041\nAddress: P.O.

   }
   ```

8. As you can see from the search results, the addition of cognitive skills adds valuable metadata to your search index, and helps to make documents and their contents more usable by Contoso.
